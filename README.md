Bringing democracy to shared music playlists

## Vision

Allow a group of people to vote on songs in a shared playlist, thereby affecting
the frequency that the songs are played.

## Aims

1. Learn something about Python coding

1. Have fun and teach each other what we've learnt
1. Produce code we can can be proud of and include in our portfolios
1. Allow everyone, regardless of ability or commitment, to contribute
